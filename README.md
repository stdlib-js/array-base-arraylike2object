    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
arraylike2object = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-arraylike2object@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var arraylike2object = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/array-base-arraylike2object/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-arraylike2object@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.arraylike2object;
})();
</script>
```

#### arraylike2object( x )

Converts an array-like object to an object likely to have the same "shape".

```javascript
var obj = arraylike2object( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
// returns {...}
```

## Notes

-   The returned object has the following properties:

    -   **data**: reference to the input array.
    -   **dtype**: input array data type. If unable to resolve the [data type][@stdlib/array/dtype] of the input array, the property value is `null`.
    -   **accessorProtocol**: `boolean` indicating whether the input uses accessors for getting and setting elements.
    -   **accessors**: a two-element array whose first element is an accessor for retrieving an array element (i.e., a getter) and whose second element is an accessor for setting an array element (i.e., a setter).

-   The getter accessor accepts two arguments:

    -   **data**: input array.
    -   **idx**: element index.

-   The setter accessor accepts three arguments:

    -   **data**: input array.
    -   **idx**: element index.
    -   **value**: value to set.

-   This function is intended as a potential performance optimization. In V8, for example, even if two objects share common properties, if those properties were added in different orders or if one object has additional properties not shared by the other object, then those objects will have different "hidden" classes. If a function is provided many objects having different "shapes", some JavaScript VMs (e.g., V8) will consider the function "megamorphic" and fail to perform various runtime optimizations. Accordingly, the intent of this function is to standardize the "shape" of the object holding array meta data to ensure that internal functions operating on arrays are provided consistent argument "shapes".
